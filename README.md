# Concepts in Object Oriented Programming

## Class

- template for the creation of an object

### `__init__` (initializer)
- Use the `__init__()` function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created

### Atrribute (Parameter)s
- descriptions of the object
- instance attribute (first_name)
- class - level attribute (WSU)

### Methods (Action)
- instance method
    - method that can be perform on the object
- class method
    -allows us to create and modify class level data
- static method
    - does not have access to class or instance attributes but perfroms actions within the class
- magic method
    - reserved methods that perform a specific task `__str__`

    ## Inheritance
    -inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class
    - Parent Class (student)
    - Child Class (Graduate Student)

    ## Polymorphism
    - methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes
